## 🎯 The Big Picture

### The Problem We Solve 💥

**Traditional Software Development:**
```
Developer writes code → Manual code review → Bugs slip through → Production crashes
                ↓                ↓                  ↓                    ↓
            Takes hours      Human fatigue    30-40% missed      Customer impact
```

**Cost of Bugs:** 
- 🔴 Critical production bug = $100,000+ in lost revenue
- 🔴 Security breach = Millions in damages + reputation loss
- 🔴 Poor code quality = Technical debt that slows everything
